<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This requires me to create Ruby linters to further make life easy for me and other programmers. I have created 2 Ruby linters to check

1. AMBIGUITY IN METHOD: This cop checks for ambiguous block association with method when param passed without parentheses.

2. LAYOUT STYLE INDENTATION: Bare access modifiers (those not applying to specific methods) should be indented as deep as method definitions, or as deep as the class/module keyword, depending on configuration.

## How To Use

The user can easily modify the rules of:

- Line Length
- Block Length
- Class Length
- Indentation

To fit each projects specifics. In order to do it, please go to:

```
$ cd /root-project-folder/
$ cd bin
```

/root-project-folder/bin

Open **_main_** file using the text editor of your preference.

### Built With
